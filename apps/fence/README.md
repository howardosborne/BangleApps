# what's it all about
The idea is to help improve fencing skills

## tracking a session
record sensors over a whole session
for example, how does temperature/heart rate change?
track time
track temperature
track heart rate
track movement in x/y/z and summary
- need start/stop session button
- on stopping a session want to show/save/export the data
- want to show summary info and pretty graphs

## track match/bout - same as a session
record arm / weapon position
- need start/stop session button
- on stopping a session want to show/save/export the data

## track attacks/defences
measure the arc of an attack (or defence)
how fast do you accelerate
are there any 'tells' such as a wiggle before an attack
is there inefficient thrust or bad habits

## practice attacks / defences
explicitly practice

## sensors
temperature
heart rate
acceleration

### key questions
how to identify the start and stop of an attack
gesture?

### activities
prototype measuring attacks
prototype whole interface
